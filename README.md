# Visual-Question-Answering
Transformer based neural network used to answer questions about images. The transformer was trained on the Visual Genome dataset that has 1.5 million question-answer pairs for images. The pretrained model is a MobileNetV3Small selected for size efficiency. The transformer model was inspired by the tensorflow image captioning tutorial.
